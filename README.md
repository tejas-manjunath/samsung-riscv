<summary><b>Task 1:</b> Install the RISC-V toolchain using the VDI link, then compile the C code using both the normal GCC compiler and the RISC-V GCC compiler to compare the results. Refer to the provided C-based and RISC-V lab videos for guidance on completing the task.</summary>

**C Lab**

We start by creating a file in the chosen directory using a simple editor like Leafpad. After writing the program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n, save the file, close the editor, and compile it using GCC. Once compiled, you can run the program to see the output.

### C Code to calculate 1 to n numbers

$ #include<stdio.h>
