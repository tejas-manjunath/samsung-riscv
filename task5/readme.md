#  Traffic Control System with Emergency Button using RISC V processor

## Overview:
This project is a simple traffic control system using a RISC-V processor (SiFive HiFive1) to simulate a traffic light. The system will control three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) to represent traffic lights and provide manual control through push buttons for pedestrian crossing and emergency override. Optionally, a buzzer alerts users during an emergency override.

## Features:
* Automatic traffic light control (Red, Yellow, Green) using LEDs.
* Manual control with push buttons for pedestrian crossing and emergency override.
* Optional buzzer to signal emergency override.
* Simple code logic for controlling the traffic lights and handling user input.
